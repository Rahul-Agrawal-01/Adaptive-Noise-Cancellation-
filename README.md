# Adaptive-Noise-Cancellation-
This project implements an Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) system using the LMS algorithm in MATLAB. It removes background noise from a primary signal using a reference noise input. Commonly used in hearing aids, voice assistants, and biomedical devices. Includes code, flowchart, and results.
